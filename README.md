# Random Rune

## Generates a Random Elder Futhark Runestave

This app generates a random runestave from the Elder Futhark and displays a possible meaning that the user can take as a metaphysical message from the universe. All for fun.

## Purpose

A quick project (that was temporarily waylaid by the lockdown) to practice CSS skills, work with HTML entities and implement a sleep function using a Promise. I also added an animated background using the P5 library, just to add visual interest... and to increase the metaphysical qualities of the UI.

### Futhark English

The app's title and directions are shown in English, using the Elder Futhark. With a little practice, you should be able to read it quite easily.

#### Other Notes

Latin letters for the button and rune meaning are displayed using the Baloo Bhai 2 font, which is actually a Gujarati font that includes a Latin script. The space character in Baloo Bhai 2 is super narrow.

#### Fun fact

Guajatari and European DNA indicates that we split from a common group about 8,000 years ago.
